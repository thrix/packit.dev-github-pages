      <description>Creating CentOS Stream 9 source-git repositories #  Source-git repos for CentOS Stream 9 are stored as separate repositories in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/src in c9s branches.
Here is how the repositories should be set up:
  They are open to the public (for contributions).
  Issues are disabled (BZ is the official bug tracker).
  Merge requests are enabled.

      <title>Source-git patch metadata</title>

      <description>Source-git patch metadata #  Patch metadata have been superseded by Git-native trailers. This old patch metadata format is still supported if none of the Git-trailers are found in any of the commits.
The metadata are a way for users and creators of source-git repos to be in control of how packit generates patch files from downstream commits. Users are not meant to set most of these - our tooling does that: dist2src and packit source-git init.</description>
