repositories to build the container images for Packit Service and push them
to Quay.io.</li>
<li>Tomáš fixed a bug in the linearization mechanism used when generating patch
files from a series of Git commits. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1144">packit#1144</a>)</li>
<li>Hunor implemented a way for <code>packit</code> to detect if patch-files generated from
Git are identical with the ones already in dist-git. This should help
avoiding superfluous changes done by <code>propose-downstream</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1133">packit#1133</a>)</li>
<li>Jirka increased the delay (to 3 minutes in total) for Packit Service when
retrying downloading the sources during a <code>propose-downstream</code> job. This
should give more time for the sources to become available after a release is
created. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1019">packit-service#1019</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>We have introduced new options for generating SRPM packages:
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1396">packit#1396</a>)
<ul>
<li><code>--no-bump</code> that prevents changing of the release in the SRPM,
which can be used for creating SRPMs on checked out tags/releases.</li>
<li><code>--release-suffix</code> that allows you to customize the suffix after the release number,
e.g. reference bugzilla or specific branch of the build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copr build installation instructions now contain detailed info about
the built packages, so you can install the precise build from your pull request.

<ul>
<li>We have introduced a new configuration option <code>merge_pr_in_ci</code> that allows you to disable merging of PR into the base branch before creating SRPM in service. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1395">packit#1395</a>, <a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1261">packit-service#1261</a>)</li>
<li>If the upstream spec file is located in a subdirectory (such as
<code>packaging/fedora/pkg.spec</code>), it is now correctly synced to the root of
the downstream repository, since that&rsquo;s where rpmbuild will look
for it. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1402">packit#1402</a>)</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; comment no longer has a disclaimer about our intentions to stop posting it by default. We have already made that move earlier this year, so the disclaimer is no longer relevant. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1260">packit-service#1260</a>)</li>
<li>Deprecated configuration options <code>current_version_command</code> and <code>create_tarball_command</code> have been removed and are no longer supported. They are superseded by actions <code>get-current-version</code> and <code>create-archive</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1397">packit#1397</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>We have fixed several issues in packit when it&rsquo;s periodically checking
statuses of jobs. You should now reliably see up to date check statuses for
Copr RPM builds and Testing Farm runs.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1267">packit-service#1267</a>),
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1265">packit-service#1265</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue, which raised a <code>UnicodeEncodingError</code>, when working with
dist-git patch files with an encoding other than UTF-8.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1406">packit#1406</a>)</li>
<li>Backup alias definitions now reflect the official release of Fedora 35.

<ul>
<li>You can now specify <code>skip_build</code> option in the test job metadata in the
Packit configuration file. This will cause no Copr build to be built and
installed into the testing environment, but only trigger the tests in
Testing Farm (the selected components to be installed should be part of the
TMT definitions).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1256">packit-service#1256</a>)</li>
<li>Packit supports <code>changelog-entry</code> action that is used when creating SRPM.
The action is supposed to generate whole changelog entry (including <code>- </code> at
the start of the lines) and has a priority over any other way we modify the
changelog with. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1367">packit#1367</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>A new <code>env</code> config option has been added for specifying environment variables,
which are then passed to Testing Farm along with some more pre-defined
variables (e.g. name of the project, URL, etc).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1411">packit#1411</a>)
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1275">packit-service#1275</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>You can set up a new <code>koji_build</code> job using the commit trigger to submit a
Koji build for a new commit in a dist-git branch. The configuration file
needs to be present in the dist-git for now
(the state for the new commit is used).

<ul>
<li>External contributors can&rsquo;t trigger internal tests initially. Project
maintainers need to trigger the action via <code>/packit test</code> comment to run
the job.

(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1305">packit-service#1305</a>)</li>
<li>A new <code>packit prepare-sources</code> command has been implemented for preparing
sources for an SRPM build using the content of an upstream repository.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1424">packit#1424</a>)</li>
<li>Packit now visibly informs about an ongoing cloning process to remove
potential confusion.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1431">packit#1431</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>upstream_package_name</code> config option is now checked for illegal
characters and an error is thrown if it contains them.
