(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1315">packit/packit-service#1315</a>)</li>
<li>We have added <code>target_branch_head_commit</code> property to the <code>PullRequest</code> class in ogr that allows
you to get commit hash of the HEAD of the target branch (i.e. base, where the changes are merged to).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/ogr/pull/671">packit/ogr#671</a>)</li>
<li>Service now passes <code>PACKIT_TARGET_SHA</code> variable, which holds commit hash of the HEAD of the target
branch where the changes are supposed to be merged, to the Testing Farm environment. This should
help solving the issue of running tests from non-merged codebase on the Testing Farm side.

<li>Packit now allows specifying more test distros for one build target
to test on in Testing Farm in the configuration. The checks for the
test job will also contain the name of the actual test distro
(and not the build target as previously).</li>
<li>A new option, <code>srpm_build_deps</code>, in the packit configuration file<br>
can be used. Which is a list of RPM dependencies that are needed for
the actions to be run when building SRPM and is an indicator to build
the SRPMs in Copr.</li>

<ul>
<li>When a specfile is being generated, and both <code>specfile_path</code> and
<code>downstream_package_name</code> are not set, Packit now correctly resolves this
situation and sets <code>specfile_path</code> to the name of the upstream repo suffixed
with <code>&quot;.spec&quot;</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1499">packit#1499</a>)</li>
<li>A new command <code>packit source-git status</code> has been introduced for checking
the synchronization of a source-git and a dist-git repository based on the
used git trailers. The command outputs a range of commits which need to be
synchronized from dist-git to source-git or the other way around. If possible,
the command also provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1500">packit#1500</a>)</li>
<li>We have added a new <code>enable_net</code> configuration option for Copr builds that
allows you to disable network access during Copr builds. It is also complemented
by <code>--enable-net</code>/<code>--disable-net</code> CLI options if you use Packit locally.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1504">packit#1504</a>)</li>
<li>Packit now adds 👀 instead of 👍 as a reaction to <code>/packit command</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1372">packit-service#1372</a>)</li>
<li>Progress of propose-downstream is now saved in the database and is available
via API. Visualization in the dashboard is to follow next week, stay tuned.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1292">packit-service#1292</a>)</li>
<li>When running tests for the pull-request job, we now expose environment
variables for commit hash, branch and URL both for pull-request source and
target. In the test environment, you can use the following variables:
<code>PACKIT_SOURCE_SHA</code>, <code>PACKIT_TARGET_SHA</code>, <code>PACKIT_SOURCE_BRANCH</code>,
<code>PACKIT_TARGET_BRANCH</code>, <code>PACKIT_SOURCE_URL</code> and <code>PACKIT_TARGET_URL</code>.
These variables are not set for test runs of releases and branch pushes.

<li>You can view information about ongoing propose-downstream jobs via our dashboard.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/168">dashboard#168</a>)</li>
<li>We have switched the cache for dist-git branches and Copr targets to TTL cache
that gets discarded once in 12 hours, in case there is a change in targets, the
changes shall propagate to both of our deployments without the need to redeploy
within 12 hours. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1513">packit#1513</a>)</li>
<li>Packit now comments when it fails to find Copr project specified in the config.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1395">packit#1395</a>)</li>
<li>Packit now reacts to dist-git pushes to either <code>rawhide</code> or <code>main</code> when configured
to do Koji builds for <code>rawhide</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1393">packit#1393</a>)</li>
<li>You can specify an identifier for your job to be able to configure one job multiple times.
For example, you can build multiple projects from one repository (known as monorepo concept)
or try multiple build options. Using identifiers allows Packit to avoid naming collisions
in commit statuses and default Copr project names.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1385">packit-service#1385</a>)</li>
<li>Packit no longer provides a misleading comment when it fails to update a set of
targets on its own Copr projects.

<li>When using Packit CLI for creating Bodhi updates,
you can now set <code>fas_username</code> and <code>fas_password</code> in your Packit user config

<li>Interactions with Bodhi should be now more reliable when creating Bodhi updates.

<li>Packit will no longer error out when trying to create a new Copr repository
when it is already present.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1527">packit#1527</a>)</li>
<li>There is a new <code>packit_instances</code> key that you can use to specify the Packit
instances you want to use for working on your jobs. Nothing will change for our
production users, but users of our stage instance need to use this key to
preserve the support of the stage instance &ndash; they can set both stg and prod in
the <code>packit_instances</code> list to use both, or use just one. Just be careful with
the downstream jobs where both instances work with the same services.
This new option works like other Packit options so you can set it on the top
level and/or (re)define it on the job level.
More information about our staging instance can be found here:

<li><code>packit source-git update-dist-git</code> and <code>packit source-git update-source-git</code> now check the synchronization of source-git and dist-git repositories prior to doing the update. If the update can&rsquo;t be done, for example, because the histories have diverged, the command provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories.
A <code>--force</code> option is available to try to update the destination repository anyway.

<li>We have introduced two new build and test target aliases: <code>fedora-latest-stable</code> resolves to the latest stable Fedora
Linux release, while <code>fedora-branched</code> resolves to all branched releases (all Fedora Linux release, except <code>rawhide</code>).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1546">packit#1546</a>)</li>
<li>We have reverted the functionality of Packit that allowed you to have set <strong>only</strong> specific targets for Copr repositories.
This functionality was introduced a while ago and was found to be not very beneficial in cases of differently
configured Copr jobs building in parallel in the same Copr repository. This is an implementation detail in the end,
but Copr project chroots are now only added and never subtracted
(every build has precisely specified targets based on the copr_build job definition).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1551">packit#1551</a>)</li>
<li>If you are using our stage instance, we make it listen only on <code>/packit-stg</code> comment commands so you can now differentiate
between the instances when commanding Packit via pull-request or issue comments.
For the production instance, you can continue using <code>/packit</code> prefix as you are used to.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1432">packit-service#1432</a>)</li>
<li>A new configuration option <code>downstream_branch_name</code> has been added, which is meant to be used in source-git projects

<li><code>revision-range</code> argument of the source-git <code>update-source-git</code> command is now optional. If not specified,

packit now correctly handles pagination of API results. This resolves an issue that caused
Fedora 37 not to be pointed to from any alias.

<li>Packit now deduces Copr targets for Copr builds when you have set your custom Copr project to be used. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1673">packit-service#1673</a>)</li>
<li>Retriggering tasks via re-run button in Github commit checks when there are configured identifiers for jobs should now work correctly. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1671">packit-service#1671</a>)</li>

<li>Users can now <strong>allow</strong> building in a custom Copr project from a <em>git-forge</em> project.
User has to add manually the <em>git-forge</em> project reference to the Copr project settings.
As an example, we should add <em>github.com/packit/ogr</em> to the list named <em>Packit forge project allowed</em> in our <em>packit-dev</em> Copr project settings: <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/packit-dev/edit#packit_forge_projects_allowed">https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/packit-dev/edit#packit_forge_projects_allowed</a>.

<li>Packit now correctly authenticates with Bodhi 6 and therefore creates Bodhi updates. 🚀 (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1746">packit#1746</a>, <a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1704">packit-service#1704</a>)</li>
<li>There are two changes in the naming of the service jobs:
The <code>build</code> job type name has been deprecated. It aimed to be an alias when Packit supported just one build type.
There are currently more types of builds and just <code>build</code> can be misleading. Please, be explicit and use <code>copr_build</code> instead.
The <code>production_build</code> name for upstream Koji build is misleading because it is not used to run production/non-scratch
builds and because it can be confused with the <code>koji_build</code> job that is triggered for dist-git commits.
(The <code>koji_build</code> job can trigger both scratch and non-scratch/production builds.)
To be explicit, use <code>upstream_koji_build</code> for builds triggered in upstream and <code>koji_build</code> for builds triggered in downstream.
Users will get a neutral status describing the change when the old names are in use. The status will become a warning
starting in November and the old names will be removed by the end of the year. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1656">packit-service#1656</a>)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve fixed the Markdown table format in the GitHub checks page, which was broken when the user&rsquo;s repo was not allowed to use Packit. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1688">packit-service#1688</a>)</li>

we switch to building all SRPMs in Copr in January.

<li>We&rsquo;ve increased internal task retry backoff time in Packit GitHub app from 3 to
7 seconds. We hope this will increase success for network flakes and <em>random</em>
infrastructure issues. Creation of bodhi updates should be now more reliable too
as Packit will try more times (from 2 to 5).

it is also possible to use tag properties (e.g. <code>Specfile.version</code>, <code>Specfile.license</code>)
inside them. It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding the <code>with</code>
statement, by using the <code>content</code> property (e.g. <code>Specfile.tags().content</code>), but
be aware that no modifications done to such data will be preserved. You must use
<code>with</code> to make changes.
